# The Modern Periodic Table

## Structure of the Periodic Table
The modern periodic table, also known as the long form, consists of:
* **7 Horizontal Periods**: These are the horizontal rows in the table.
* **18 Vertical Columns**: These are the vertical columns, also known as Groups.

## The Four Main Blocks
The periodic table is divided into four main blocks based on the sublevels being filled with electrons:
1.  **s-block**: Includes Groups 1A and 2A on the left side of the table.
2.  **p-block**: Includes Groups 3A through 8A (or Group 0) on the right side of the table.
3.  **d-block**: Contains the Transition Elements, located in the middle of the table.
4.  **f-block**: Contains the Inner-Transition Elements (Lanthanides and Actinides), located separately at the bottom.

## Classification of Elements
The elements in the modern periodic table can be classified into four main types:
* **1. Noble Elements (Inert Gases)**: These are the elements in Group 8A (Group 0 or 18). They are generally unreactive.
* **2. Representative Elements**: These are the elements in the s-block and p-block, specifically Groups 1A through 7A.
* **3. Main Transition Elements**: These are the elements in the d-block, specifically Groups 3B through 2B.
* **4. Inner Transition Elements**: These are the elements in the f-block, which consists of the 4f series (Lanthanides) and the 5f series (Actinides).

# Transition Elements

## The Four Horizontal Series
The d-block transition elements are classified into four horizontal series:
1.  **The First Transition Series**: Located in the 4th period of the periodic table. It starts with Scandium (Sc, atomic number 21) and ends with Zinc (Zn, atomic number 30).
2.  **The Second Transition Series**: Located in the 5th period. It starts with Yttrium (Y, atomic number 39) and ends with Cadmium (Cd, atomic number 48).
3.  **The Third Transition Series**: Located in the 6th period.
4.  **The Fourth Transition Series**: Located in the 7th period.

# Review of Atomic Structure

## Energy Levels and Shells
* The atom consists of a central **nucleus** (containing protons and neutrons) and **electrons** that orbit the nucleus.
* Electrons exist in principal energy levels, or shells, denoted by letters K, L, M, N, O, P, Q or numbers 1 through 7.
* The K shell (level 1) can hold up to 2 electrons.
* The L shell (level 2) can hold up to 8 electrons.

## Sublevels and Orbitals
* Each main energy level is divided into sublevels, denoted by s, p, d, and f.
* Each sublevel has a maximum number of electrons it can hold:
    * **s-sublevel**: Holds a maximum of 2 electrons.
    * **p-sublevel**: Holds a maximum of 6 electrons.
    * **d-sublevel**: Holds a maximum of 10 electrons.
    * **f-sublevel**: Holds a maximum of 14 electrons.
* Each sublevel consists of **orbitals**. An orbital is a region of space where there is a high probability of finding an electron.
* **A single orbital can be occupied by a maximum of two electrons only**, and they must have opposite spins.

# Electron Configuration Rules

To determine the electronic configuration of an atom, three main rules are followed.

## 1. The Aufbau Principle (Building-up Principle)
* **Principle**: Electrons occupy the energy sublevels with the lowest energy first, before filling sublevels with higher energy.
* **Order of Filling**: The sublevels are filled in the following order: 1s < 2s < 2p < 3s < 3p < 4s < 3d < 4p < 5s < 4d < 5p < 6s < 4f < 5d < 6p < 7s < 5f < 6d < 7p.
* **Using Inert Gases**: For simplification, electron configurations can be written using the preceding inert gas in brackets.
    * [He] (2)
    * [Ne] (10)
    * [Ar] (18)
    * [Kr] (36)
    * [Xe] (54)
    * [Rn] (86)
* **Example for Iron (Fe, atomic number 26)**:
    * Full configuration: 1s², 2s², 2p⁶, 3s², 3p⁶, 4s², 3d⁶
    * Closest inert gas configuration: [₁₈Ar] 4s², 3d⁶
* **Example for Cadmium (Cd, atomic number 48)**:
    * Closest inert gas configuration: [₃₆Kr] 5s², 4d¹⁰

## 2. Hund's Rule
* **Principle**: No pairing of electrons occurs in the orbitals of a given sublevel until each orbital is first occupied by a single electron.
* **Example for Nitrogen (N, atomic number 7)**:
    * Configuration is 1s², 2s², 2p³.
    * The three electrons in the 2p sublevel will occupy the three separate p-orbitals individually (↑ ↑ ↑) rather than pairing up.
* **Example for Oxygen (O, atomic number 8)**:
    * Configuration is 1s², 2s², 2p⁴.
    * The four electrons in the 2p sublevel will first fill the three orbitals singly, and the fourth electron will then pair up in the first p-orbital (↑↓ ↑ ↑).
* **Example for Iron (Fe, atomic number 26)**:
    * The configuration ends in 3d⁶.
    * The five d-orbitals are first filled with 5 single electrons, and the sixth electron then pairs up in the first d-orbital.

# Writing Ionic Chemical Formulas

To write the formula for an ionic compound:
1.  Identify the positive ion (**cation**) and the negative ion (**anion**).
2.  Write their symbols and valencies (charges).
3.  Exchange the numerical values of the charges and write them as subscripts.

* **Example: Magnesium Chloride**
    * Magnesium (Mg) is in Group 2A, so its valency is +2.
    * Chloride (Cl) is in Group 7A, so its valency is -1.
    * The 2 from Mg goes to Cl, and the 1 from Cl goes to Mg.
    * The formula is **MgCl₂**.
* **Example: Iron (III) Sulphate**
    * Iron (III) (Fe) is given a valency of +3.
    * Sulphate (SO₄) is a radical with a valency of -2.
    * The 3 from Fe goes to the entire SO₄ group, and the 2 from SO₄ goes to Fe.
    * The formula is **Fe₂(SO₄)₃**.

# Calculating Oxidation Numbers

* **In a neutral compound**: The sum of the oxidation numbers of all atoms is equal to **zero**.
* **In an ion**: The sum of the oxidation numbers of all atoms is equal to the **charge of the ion**.

* **Example: Manganese in KMnO₄**
    * K + Mn + 4(O) = 0
    * Potassium (K) is +1. Oxygen (O) is typically -2.
    * (+1) + Mn + 4(-2) = 0
    * 1 + Mn - 8 = 0
    * Mn - 7 = 0
    * Therefore, **Mn = +7**.

* **Example: Sulphur in sulphite ion (SO₃)⁻²**
    * S + 3(O) = -2
    * S + 3(-2) = -2
    * S - 6 = -2
    * S = -2 + 6
    * Therefore, **S = +4**.
